EPIC 3: SESSION SCHEDULING & AVAILABILITY
Context: After the initial assessment, subsequent therapy sessions need to be scheduled manually by the therapist, taking into account various constraints.
User Story 3.1: Manual Session Scheduling
As a Therapist
I want to schedule subsequent therapy sessions
So that both the young person and I can agree on suitable times
Acceptance Criteria:
The therapist can access a scheduling interface after sessions
The system displays the therapist's availability within the platform
Young people do not need to log in to confirm appointments; the therapist finalizes the booking
The system sends automated confirmation messages to young people after scheduling
The system supports recurring appointments if needed
Assumptions:
Therapists will handle scheduling during therapy sessions while the young person is present
Young people don't need a system login, with communication happening via email/SMS links
TCS will provide a SMTP server for the emails
TCS will provide an SMS service for the SMS messages
The scheduling interface needs to be simple and efficient for therapists to use during sessions
User Story 3.2: Therapist Availability Management
As a Therapist
I want to manage my availability within the system
So that I'm not double-booked across different young people
Acceptance Criteria:
The system maintains a calendar of each therapist's appointments
When scheduling, the system prevents booking conflicts for the same therapist
Therapists can block out periods when they are unavailable for sessions
The system does not require integration with external calendars (Google, Outlook)
Therapists can set recurring availability patterns (e.g., only available Tuesday-Thursday)
The calls will be scheduled for an hour, with 50 minutes of the therapy session and 10 minutes left to schedule the next call. The control of this is done by the therapist, who will be very used to keeping times of sessions
Assumptions:
Therapists need to block out unavailable times and see their full schedule within the platform
EPIC 4: COMMUNICATIONS & SCHEDULING CHANGES
Context: Young people need to receive appointment reminders and have mechanisms to request changes without requiring system login.
User Story 4.1: Appointment Reminders
As a Young Person
I want to receive automated reminders about upcoming sessions
So that I don't miss my appointments
Acceptance Criteria:
The system sends confirmation messages immediately after booking a session
Reminder messages are sent the day before scheduled sessions
Messages include essential details: date, time, therapist name, and session link
Young people can choose their preferred communication method (email or SMS)
Communications are appropriately branded according to TCS guidelines
Reminder timing is configurable within the system administration
Assumptions:
Young people will specify their preferred communication method (email/SMS) during initial consent
Reminders will be sent both when the appointment is booked and the day before the session
Communications must be appropriately branded (TCS or co-branded depending on the referring organization)
The platform should track the delivery status of communications to identify potential issues
User Story 4.2: Scheduling Therapist-initiated Changes
As a Therapist
I want to cancel or reschedule sessions when necessary
So that young people are promptly informed of any changes
Acceptance Criteria:
Therapists can cancel sessions through the system, triggering automated notifications
Canceled sessions do not count against the young person's session allocation
The system facilitates proposing alternative times when cancellations occur
All cancellations and changes are logged for reporting purposes
The system distinguishes between different cancellation reasons (therapist unavailability, technical issues, etc.)
Cancellations made within 24 hours of the session are flagged in reporting
Assumptions:
Therapist-initiated cancellations should not count against the young person's 12-session allocation
The system must differentiate between therapist cancellations and young person no-shows
Notifications of cancellations must be immediate and via the young person's preferred method
Rescheduling should be streamlined to minimize disruption to the therapeutic relationship
Reporting on cancellation patterns is important for service quality monitoring
