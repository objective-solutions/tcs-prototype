EPIC 1: ORGANIZATION & SESSION MANAGEMENT
Context: Multiple organizations (local authorities, schools, corporations) purchase blocks of therapy sessions that need to be managed, allocated, and tracked within the system.
User Story 1.1: Create Organization Accounts
As a TCS Coordinator
I want to create and configure new organization accounts with an initial number of therapy sessions
So that organizations can start referring young people for therapy sessions
Acceptance Criteria:
The system allows manual input of organization details and total sessions purchased
The system displays real-time available session balances for each organization
Organizations become active in the system immediately after setup
The platform allows for specific branding requirements (TCS branded initially, with future white-label capability)
Assumptions:
Organizations can have different roles in the system - some will be purchasers of sessions, others will be referrers only
Organization setup will be completed by TCS staff, not by the organizations themselves
Purchasing happens outside the system, but the system must track available sessions
The platform will need to support co-branding/white-labeling for corporate and local authority customers
Organizations will need different access levels depending on their role (purchaser vs. referrer)
User Story 1.2: Session Ringfencing
As a TCS Coordinator or Referrer
I want the system to automatically reserve 12 sessions when a new young person is referred
So that each young person has a guaranteed allocation for their therapy journey
Acceptance Criteria:
The system verifies the organization has at least 12 available sessions before allowing a referral
If insufficient sessions remain, the system blocks the referral and notifies the userappropriate staff
Upon successful referral, 12 sessions are marked as "reserved" for that young person
Unused sessions automatically return to the organization's available pool if therapy ends early
The system maintains an audit log of all session allocations and returns
Assumptions:
The 12-session allocation is the standard package for all young people as specified in the RFQ
Ringfencing happens immediately at referral time, before consent or assessment
Organizations need visibility on their available session pool after ringfencing
The system must track and distinguish between used, reserved, and available sessions
Automatic release of unused sessions must be triggered by explicit therapy closure, not just inactivity
