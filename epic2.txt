EPIC 2: REFERRAL PROCESS & CONSENT
Context: The referral process requires capturing the young person's details, obtaining appropriate consent, and scheduling an initial assessment session.
User Story 2.1: Young Person Referral
As a Referring Organization
I want to input a young person's details and secure sessions for them
So they can begin receiving mental health support
Acceptance Criteria:
The referral form captures essential information: name, contact details, and any scheduling constraints
The system verifies sufficient session availability (minimum 12) before proceeding
Successful referrals automatically ringfence 12 sessions for the young person
Referrers receive confirmation when the referral is processed successfully
The system automatically flags any duplicate referrals based on name and contact details
Assumptions:
Referring organizations will have obtained initial permission to share the young person's details
The referral organization may be different from the purchasing organization
The system must support referrals from schools that haven't directly purchased the sessions
Referrers need confirmation that the referral has been received and sessions ringfenced
Duplicate checking is essential to prevent multiple referrals for the same young person
User Story 2.2: Consent Management
As the System
I want to obtain and record appropriate consent from young people
So that therapy can proceed in compliance with ethical and legal requirements
Acceptance Criteria:
Upon referral, an automated consent request is sent to the young person
Therapy sessions cannot proceed until consent is confirmed
All consent actions are logged with timestamps for audit purposes
The system provides clear documentation of what the young person is consenting to
Assumptions:
Digital consent is legally sufficient for this service when properly implemented
Young people can choose their preferred communication method for consent requests
Consent records must be maintained in the system
User Story 2.3: Initial Session Scheduling
As the System
I want to automatically schedule the first assessment session
So that the therapy process can begin promptly after consent
Acceptance Criteria:
The therapist proposes an initial assessment time
Young people can accept the proposed time or request alternatives through a simple response mechanism
Upon confirmation, session details are automatically communicated to both the therapist and the young person
The system logs the scheduled assessment in the therapist's calendar to prevent double-booking
The system sends appropriate reminders before the initial assessment
Assumptions:
Assessment is counted as session 1 of the 12 allocated sessions
The initial assessment will determine the pattern for subsequent sessions
Confirmation and reminders must be sent via the young person's preferred communication method
Automated scheduling reduces administrative burden while maintaining flexibility for rescheduling
